## Autopipe

For easy setup of your environment, install Anaconda and use the following:
`conda env create -f environment.yml`

`source activate autopipe`

This will install all libraries and dependencies required to run the programs

serialize.py will write a directory of images to disk as a binary dictionary containing
numpy arrays of image pixels.  When writing to disk, the data is split into a train/test/valid set.

It is also used to deserialize the .pkl file for future use.

image_process.py is used for preprocessing of the images.
Grayscaling, image normalization is done here.

`python serialize.py` will get all the data from a specific folder and serialize it into a .pkl file
that can be loaded up as a .  The actual images should be split into defect and nondefect directories.
These should be taken off of AWS.

`python model.py` will create a model based on the location of the data_pkl file.  Make sure to modify
where the location is.

Define where the model is actually located after generating it in `predictions.py`

To run the entire program, from the root directory (autopipe) type: 
`make gui`

To use autopipe:
1) First create the appropiate folders to store the images, models, and pkl files.
	- The filepaths should be described with the open commands
2) Run the serialize.py script to create the image data package.
	- The images are cropped in the crop function in the images_process.py function
3) To get the model, run model.py
	- Model names are dependent on what is the END_IMAGE_SIZE variable is
4) To test the model, run predictions.py
	- A step further would be to run the GUI, which is up to the tester.

## UI

Inside the ui folder contains the ui file that can be modified in qt designer.
This is a temporary file that generates a skeleton of our ui code.
The actual logic for the ui is defined inside autopipe/gui.py

To rebuild the UI: `make bgui`
